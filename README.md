This is a project I made for an assignment with springboard. It is a pretty basic player search using the balldontlie api. With this, you can look up player stats. Within the player stat page, you can compare their performances to a betting line of your choice. For example, you can check how many times they've put up more than 12 points this season. You can also check teams wins and losses this season. This may be interesting if you want to know how a team is performing overall on the season. I may add more features in the future as I have more time.
